# Procedural Terrain Generation Tool

It is a (hopefully) powerful software designed to bring virtual landscapes to life. It generates a heightmap, followed by a texture, and then creates a painted terrain based on the noise data.

### Key features:

- Supports 4 algorithms of noise generation (White Noise, ​Perlin Noise, Diamond-Square, and Worley Noise). Each algorithm offers unique characteristics and can be tailored to specific terrain generation needs.​
- Includes different terrain sizes and 3 stunning color schemes to enhance realism and aesthetics​.
_**Tip:** try generating Worley Noise with a WaterSurface color scheme. You won't regret._
- Allows to preserve and revisit favorite terrains with ease using the save/load functionality.
